Subject: Look for sitecustomize.pl in /etc/perl rather than sitelib on Debian
 systems

Debian uses this sitecustomize.pl as a transition mechanism for removing
the current working directory (".") from @INC by default while leaving
the local administrator a temporary means of re-adding it back.

This mechanism is expected to be removed after one Debian stable release.
