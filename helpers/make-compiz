# Need to remove an 'option' in the XML file.
# It extends for five lines, so we will comment
# them out.

# The C++ code calls methods that appear to be based
# on the part of the XML file that we removed. 
# There is a method that returns a boolean to
# indicate whether or not this feature should
# be exhibited. I've created a dummy method 
# that always returns false for that.
# It's declared as "extern" in the "*.h" file.
# It's defined at the end of the "*.cpp" file.
# There is another call to a related method.
# I just comment out that call.
